## Thanks:
Partly based on [Amazon Alexa Remote Control](http://blog.loetzimmer.de/2017/10/amazon-alexa-hort-auf-die-shell-echo.html) (PLAIN shell) and [alexa-remote-control](https://github.com/thorsten-gehrig/alexa-remote-control) and [OpenHab-Addon](https://github.com/openhab/openhab2-addons/blob/f54c9b85016758ff6d271b62d255bbe41a027928/addons/binding/org.openhab.binding.amazonechocontrol)
Thank you for that work.

### 3.7.0 (2021-02-03)
* (Apollon77) Implement new method to get History/Activities
  * getActivities Method is still there and still triggers the Amazon route as till now. INo idea ng it still works for some users. I declared it as deprecated now
  * add new method "getCustomerHistoryRecords" which uses another endpoint on Amazon side and delivers different data. The return is returned relative compatible to getActivities, so should be a drop in replacement - beside the fact that some fileds can not be provided any longer and will be simply empty! (e.g. activityStatus, deviceAccountId ...) Also in the amazon data some fields are no longer existing (e.g. domainAttributes ...)
  * the event "ws-device-activity" is migrated to use the new getCustomerHistoryRecords endpoint, and so returns compatible, but not 100% the same data
